# Crop Yield Prediction

## Problem Understanding
Agriculture is an important sector in India. Predicting crop yield in advance helps farmers plan irrigation, fertilizer usage, and marketing. Due to climate changes and multiple influencing factors, manual prediction is difficult. This project uses machine learning techniques to predict crop yield based on historical agricultural data.

## Model Pipeline
1. Data collection from historical crop datasets  
2. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
3. Feature selection  
4. Model training using machine learning algorithms  
5. Model testing and evaluation  
6. Crop yield prediction  

## Results and Metrics
The model predicts crop yield with good accuracy. Performance is evaluated using:
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- R² Score  

The results show that the model can be effectively used for crop yield estimation and decision-making.
